		I'm giving you a night call to tell you how I feel<br>
		I want to drive you through the night, down the hills<br>
		I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear<br>
		I'm gonna show you where it's dark, but have no fear<br>
		<br>
		There's something inside you<br>
		It's hard to explain<br>
		They're talking about you boy<br>
		But you're still the same<br>

		There's something inside you<br>
		It's hard to explain<br>
